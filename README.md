App Idea 

- Social Media App for Programmers: 
Connects programmers from around the world no matter their level of experience. It will have different communities such as for those underrepresented in computer science or for those looking for an internship. Opportunities will be posted on a frequent basis. Some features of the app will include a personal feed, a messaging feature, and the ability to post photos and memes. The goal of the app is to create a fun environment for programmers and this will be done by encouraging collaboration through events such as hackathons. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

First attempt was unsuccessful because XCode was not letting me add multiple labels to the main storyboard file. To fix the issue, I created a new project and got Xcode working properly. When implementing the bonus feature, I struggled for a bit but eventually managed to get the button to function as intended. Overall, it was a learning process which helped me better understand UI and connections and become familiar with the Xcode IDE.
