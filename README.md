App Idea 

- Social Media App for Programmers: 
Connects programmers from around the world no matter their level of 
experience. It will have different communities such as for those 
underrepresented in computer science or for those looking for an internship.
Opportunities will be posted on a frequent basis. Some features of the app
include a messaging feature, the ability to post photos, and a personal feed. The 
goal of the app is to create a fun environment and to encourage collaboration 
such as through hackathons with prizes. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

First attempt was unsuccessful because XCode was not letting me add multiple labels to the main storyboard file. I realized this was a bug, so I created a new project and this time XCode worked properly. When implmenting the bonus feature (a button to change the color of the text to a random color), I encountered some difficulty. However, it helped me better understand how the UI and connections work and in the end I managed to get the button to function as intended.
