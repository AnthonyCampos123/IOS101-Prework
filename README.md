App Idea 

- Social Media App for Programmers
Connects programmers from around the world no matter their level of 
experience. It will have different communities such as for those 
underrepresented in computer science or those looking for an internship.
Opportunities will be posted on a frequent basis. Some features of the app
include a messaging feature, the ability to post photos, and a personal feed. The 
goal of the app is to create a fun environment and to encourage collaboration 
such as through hackathons with prizes.
